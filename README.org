* Guessing game

** Intro

Guessing game implemented by Yunfeng Song will let you guess a number generated ramdomly from 1~10. 
In each round, you will have 6 chances to guess the number. Every time you try but fail to guess the correct number, 
the system will tell you whether it is too high or too low. If you fail to guess the correct number after 6 times,
you will never know the correct number and game status will be reset.

Hint: try to think of yourself as a program which is doing binary search algorthom. Good luck.
